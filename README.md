## Issues
Development of this application was smooth, until I ran into an issue running the application from the command line. When I entered "node index.js" I was met with an error message. I was unable to resolve this error, and therefore was not able to complete the styling of the webpage or see if the application functioned properly. I have attached an image of the eroor message I received, and look forward to re-submiting the assignment when I am able to resolve this issue.
